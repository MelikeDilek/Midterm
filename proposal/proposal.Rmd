# Introduction
In another study aiming to determine the causes of work accidents, researchers tried to find if there was a correlation between variables such as self image of people and burnout syndrome; between the level of burnout syndrome and the severity of the professional accidents; between the level of Burnout syndrome and the level of selfesteem.

The research has indicated the fact that the Burnout syndrome is felt by the employees, that work in a climate of economic uncertainty, many hours, taking on many responsibilities, placing their health at risk. 

This situation compromises their ability to contribute to the organizational goals. The imbalance between the work capacity of a person and the tasks that must be fulfilled lead to exhaustion and the Burnout Syndrome that causes work accidents.
