abstract = {The European Working Conditions Survey emphasized the fact that the professional diseases associated with psychological stress are growing in the EU‘s member states. The aim of this paper is to analyze the effects of stress and of the Burnout- Syndrome over the self-esteem of the people that have demanding activities at work. The lot of research is composed of 18 men who underwent various work accidents. The imbalance between the work capacity of a person and the demands that have to be met by a person, leads to exhaustion and the occurrence of Burnout Syndrome that leads to work accidents.}

 abstract = {Objectives Long working hours can lead to an accumulation in fatigue that may increase worker's risk of injury. However, it is not known if this association is different for men and women. Our aim was, therefore, to investigate gender differences in the effect of weekly working hours on occupational injury risk. Methods The US National Health Interview Survey is a clustered, stratified, cross-sectional sample representative of the US population, collected using in-household interviews. We pooled seven years of data (2004-2010) comprising 96 915 employed workers. Annualized injury rates per 100 workers were estimated for men and women in categories of weekly working hours (< 30, 31—40, 41—50, > 50 hours/week). Additionally, injury risk was predicted using weighted logistic regression models by weekly working hour categories, stratified by gender, including age, ethnicity, education, type of pay, occupation, body mass index, usual sleep duration, and psychological distress as covariates. Results Of 96 915 workers, 705 (0.75%) reported an injury in the last 3 months. Injury rates were higher among men and increased with increasing working hours for both genders. However, results of the adjusted logistic regression model indicated an interactive effect of working hours and gender on injury risk [odds ratio (OR) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.00-1.03). Injury risk increased among women working 41-50 hours/week (OR 1.51,95% CI 1.03-2.21 ) and > 50 hours/week (OR 1.69,95% CI 1.06-2.70) compared to 31-40 hours/week but not among men. Conclusions The findings indicate an increase in injury risk with increasing working hours among women but not men.},

	abstract = {Aims: To analyse the impact of overtime and extended working hours on the risk of occupational injuries and illnesses among a nationally representative sample of working adults from the United States. Methods: Responses from 10 793 Americans participating in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) were used to evaluate workers{\textquoteright} job histories, work schedules, and occurrence of occupational injury and illness between 1987 and 2000. A total of 110 236 job records were analysed, encompassing 89 729 person-years of accumulated working time. Aggregated incidence rates in each of five exposure categories were calculated for each NLSY survey period. Multivariate analytical techniques were used to estimate the relative risk of long working hours per day, extended hours per week, long commute times, and overtime schedules on reporting a work related injury or illness, after adjusting for age, gender, occupation, industry, and region. Results: After adjusting for those factors, working in jobs with overtime schedules was associated with a 61\% higher injury hazard rate compared to jobs without overtime. Working at least 12 hours per day was associated with a 37\% increased hazard rate and working at least 60 hours per week was associated with a 23\% increased hazard rate. A strong dose-response effect was observed, with the injury rate (per 100 accumulated worker-years in a particular schedule) increasing in correspondence to the number of hours per day (or per week) in the workers{\textquoteright} customary schedule. Conclusions: Results suggest that job schedules with long working hours are not more risky merely because they are concentrated in inherently hazardous industries or occupations, or because people working long hours spend more total time {\textquotedblleft}at risk{\textquotedblright} for a work injury. Strategies to prevent work injuries should consider changes in scheduling practices, job redesign, and health protection programmes for people working in jobs involving overtime and extended hours.},

abstract = {SUMMARY  This paper reviews the association between neurobiologically-based sleepiness/fatigue and human-error related accidents. It concludes that fatigue contributes to human error and accidents in technology-rich, industrialized societies in terms of human, environmental and economic impacts. The cultural utilization of time as expressed in 24-h work operations, combined with the widespread use of automation, will continue to escalate in the next century, further increasing the risks of fatigue-related accidents, as more people conduct vigilance-based activities at times other than the traditional daytime work hours. Fatigue management and prevention of fatigue-related catastrophes need to become a sustained priority for government, industries, labour, and the public. Scientific data are urgently needed on the most likely areas in which sleepiness-related performance failures contribute to accidents, and on the effectiveness of a wide range of potentially useful countermeasures.},
